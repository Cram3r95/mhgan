## Problems
* Normalization of rel and abs
* Imbalanced "class" problem
    * relatives min and max
    * few curves in dataset (?)
* Model output in range (0.4,0.6). Normalized
* Decoder Activation Function
    * Sigmoid
    * ReLU
    * PReLU
* Temporal Decoder
    * It takes into account full trajectory


## Experimento 1
* multi to single
* Decoder
* only social attention
* rel trajectory space (-3.5,3.5)
* metrics
    * 6.503
    * 14.565
